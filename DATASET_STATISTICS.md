# Dataset statistics
This file contains statistics for the dataset that didn't fit into the SI of the paper.
Figure 1 shows elemental prevalence plots, showing how often each chemical element occurs in the 3DSC<sub>ICSD</sub> (a) and the 3DSC<sub>MP</sub> (b). 
Figure 2 and 3 show the number of SuperCon entries with given critical temperature *T*<sub>c</sub> for the full 3DSC<sub>ICSD</sub> (a) and for each superconductor group ((b) to (h)): cuprates (b), ferrites (c), other (d), oxide (e), heavy fermion materials (f), Chevrel phases (g), carbon based materials (h). The non-superconductors are shown in orange. The left-most blue bar includes only superconductors with *T*<sub>c</sub> > 0 K.
