# Dataset statistics
This file contains dataset statistics for the 3DSC that didn't fit into the SI of the paper. They might be interesting to get a feeling for the content of the 3DSC.

Figure 1 shows elemental prevalence plots, showing how often each chemical element occurs in the 3DSC dataset. 
Figure 2 (3DSC<sub>ICSD</sub>) and 3 (3DSC<sub>MP</sub>) show histograms of the number of SuperCon entries with given critical temperature *T*<sub>c</sub>, both for the full dataset and for each of the superconductor groups mentioned in the paper: cuprates, ferrites, oxide, heavy fermion materials, Chevrel phases, carbon based materials and others.
